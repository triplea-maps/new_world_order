<br>==========================================================
<br>
<h1 style="text-align: center;font-size:120%;000000"><em>Rule Clarifications and Hints</em></h1>


<div style="text-align: center;">
<br> <b>Rules</b>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left;">
	<ul>
	<li>The ruleset of the "REVISED" version of a well known board game are used as a basis.<br><em>TripleA allows only valid moves, so it is possible to start playing without knowing the rules. There are a few exceptions to this, which are listed under "Default Rules" below.</em></li>
	<li>It is possible to play with LHTR style carrier-fighter production/movement rules by checking the carrier-ftr related property in the game options.
	<li>A move illegal using dice is illegal under LL too.<br><em>A move legal using dice is legal under LL too.</em></li>
	<li>Neutrals can be attacked in NWO, no penalties apply.</li>
	<li>Territories can only be strategically bombed up to their value.<br><em>(TTL = Territory Turn Limit)</em></li>
	<li>A couple of extra units exist in NWO, and some basic units are slightly different. Their abilities are listed in the "Units" section above, as well as restrictions applying to Bunkers and Red Dot Units.<br/><em>Bunkers and Red Dot Units can be turned off by deselecting "Use Triggers" in the game options.</em></li>
	<li>Only 1 bunker may be placed per territory per turn. Bunkers do not use up factory slots. Territories may have unlimited total bunkers in them. To limit total bunkers to the value of a territory, deselect "Unlimited Constructions". The game options "More Constructions with/without Factory" can be turned off to limit total bunkers to 1 per territory total, in territories with/without Factories.</li>
	</ul>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<br> <b>Default Rules for Disputable Situations</b>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left;">
	<ul>
	<li>Read the clarified Bunker Rules right below the unit stats!</li>
	<li>Manually (two-step) flying over Neutral territory during combat movement is considered illegal, despite being technically possible.<br><em>(helps balance G2-Paris take)</em></li>
	<li>Carrier-Ftr movement is handled according to "REVISED" Rules, with the following exceptions and clarifications:
	<br>Since the engine does not validate Fighter movement completely, this means explicitly: for EVERY Fighter, that has to be a potential landing spot provided, and YOU must make sure to follow the rules, as follows:
		<ul><li>Using a single Carrier for more than 2 Fighters, or for 2 Fighters going different directions, requiring different Carrier positions, is NOT allowed - even if LowLuck would guarantee for a Fighter to be lost.</li>
		<li>It must be shown that all Fighters can land during Combat Move phase, and that any Carriers they will be landing on CAN move there DURING Combat Move phase, with legal movements.</li>
		<li>The Carriers that will be picking up the aircraft must be CAPABLE of moving to their Pickup Destination DURING Combat Movement phase, BUT they do not actually have to make the movement until the Non-Combat Movement phase.</li>
		<li>You may NOT assume that you can move THROUGH a Cleared sea zone that has enemy units. This would be a violation of the rule above that the move must be Legal DURING the CM phase.</li>
		<li>IF the pickup destination IS a sea zone that contains enemy units, THEN enough Carriers to pick up all air units must move into that pickup destination During Combat Movement phase (and then engage in combat). 
			These Carriers must move during CM phase because we are NOT allowed to assume that the sea zone would be Cleared, and we MUST show that they can do the pickup using moves that are Legal during the Combat Movement phase.</li>
		<li>IF the pickup destination does NOT contain any enemy units, THEN the Carriers may wait until the Non-Combat Movement phase to actually make their movement. If the fighters do not survive the Carrier does not have to move to the pickup destination point, but if any fighters do survive they Must be picked up.</li>
		<li>Examples:
			<ul><li>On Moving Through A Cleared Sea Zone:
			<br>In Revised and LHTR rules, it is legal to make moves under the assumption that all your dice are hits and all enemy's dice are misses, thereby allowing the assumption that the carrier could move through the zone in non-combat-move phase.
			<br>However, <b>in NWO this move is considered illegal</b>, <em>regardless of using Dice or LowLuck</em>
			<br>Example: Sea Zones A, B, C are in a line, you have 1 carrier, 1 ftr [with only <b>2</b> movement left], and 1 sub in SZ A. In SZ B there are 80 enemy sea units, and in SZ C there are enemy transports. 
			<br>With Revised and LHTR rules, if you attack the fleet in SZ B with even a single unit, you may then attack the transports in SZ C with your ftr, because you get to assume that you will win the battle in SZ B and then pick up that ftr with your carrier during NCM.
			<br>This move is illegal in NWO, because you must show that the carrier can move there during combat movement, and during combat movement the carrier can not move there because there are enemy units in the way.
			</li>
			<li>On Moving Into An Enemy Controlled Sea Zone:
			<br>Example: Sea Zones A, B, C are in a line, you have 1 carrier, and 1 ftr [with only <b>3</b> movement left]. In SZ B there are some enemy units, and in SZ C there are enemy transports.
			<br>In this example, if the air attack SZ C then they must be picked up in SZ B. Since SZ B has enemy units, this move would be illegal unless we can show that we can pick up the units with legal moves during combat-move phase. Simply attack the enemy units in SZ B with a submarine or warship is not enough, because we are not allowed to assume the sea zone would be cleared for a non-combat move of the carriers.
			<br>Instead, we are required by the rules to send enough carriers to SZ B during combat movement (and those carriers will engange in combat with the enemy units in SZ B). If we send the carriers, it is now legal because we have shown how we will pick up the units using moves made during comat-movement phase.
			</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul></li>
	</ul>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<br> <b>Differences due to the New Phase Order</b>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left;">
	<ul>
	<li>Under the New Phase Order (combat movement before purchases), one knows about any air losses occurring during combat movement due to AA fly-overs, prior to the purchase phase.
	<li>Under the New Phase Order, a nation which is able to conquer a COMPLETELY empty enemy capital during combat move, could spend all captured money right away in the same turns purchase phase.<br><em>It is thus advised to leave one Inf behind if abandoning a capital. Prominent early example is Paris in round 3.</em>
	</ul>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<br><b>Strategical Hints for Beginners</b>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left;">
	<ul>
	<li>At beginners level, Allies are easier to play. At medium level, Axis is easier (once accustomed to a good opening).
	<li>Mastery of the units is crucial. Different units are needed for different tasks. Inf(antry) are the best value unit in terms of raw power, if needed production capacity is no issue, BigArmor give the most punch if it is. Concerning navy, air units give most all around flexibility, while t-boats give the least, but provide the most raw power for the money. 
		When a movement of 2 is enough, do not buy SuperSubs - subs are much better then. Elites are bad value, but can maximize an amphibious threat.
	<li>Early Axis objectives: Tunis should fall in round 1, Morocco in round 2, Greece in round 2 or 3 and Paris in round 3. Germany should be able to advance at least into Ukrainskaya. In case Finland is intended to hold, do not underestimate German support obligations via the Baltic. Spain may give Italy or Germany considerable extra income - careful though!
	<li>Early Allies objectives: UK should get Ankara, Iran and Iraq quickly. The US should prepare some good landing operation somewhere. Russia should exert some pressure to Finland. Consider strategical retreats for the French and the Colonials.
	<li>Usual hot spots include: Finland, Leningrad, Donetsk, Ankara-Greece, sz25 or the English Chanel, Gibraltar, Eastern Med fleets.
	<li>UK ftrs on French carriers experience awesome effective action range.
	<li>Paris can be made to fall during Germany's 2nd turn ( less then 1% total chance of failure) Expensive though!
	<li>Russia can pressure Finland hard, or attempt to stop Germany early in Ukrainskaya.
	<li>As Russia, watch out for Estonia! Axis can open the path for additional units by using (Italians), Finns(air) or Romanians(!).
	<li>Western allies can successfully invade through Spain, France, Scandinavia or even Italy itself (in the order of skill required).
	</ul>

All changes by EB unless otherwise specified<br>

<div style="text-align: center;">

<div style="text-align: left;">
General:
	<ul>
	<li>Deleted connection from SZ 58 to Lebanon. (veqryn)</li>
	<li>Updating air movement rules for disputed situations to actually match how most people interpreted and played the NWO rules. (veqryn, ice, toc4 rules discussion)</li>
	</ul>


<div style="text-align: center;">
<br> <b>Changes NWO1.8.5 to NWO1.8.6:</b>
<div style="text-align: left;">
General:
	<ul>
	<li>Renamed to remove special characters from folder and xml names. (veqryn)</li>
	<li>Included with TripleA download. (veqryn)</li>
	<li>Coded and Added "Low Luck for AntiAircraft" as an option, so that people may play with dice for normal units and LL for AA units only. (veqryn)</li>
	<li>Coded and Added "Low Luck for Bombing and Territory Damage" as an option. If true, strat bombing will only rolls 3s and 4s, no other numbers. (veqryn)</li>
	<li>Coded and Added "Units Repair Hits Start Turn" as an option, which if true will have Battleships and Bunkers (any 2-hitpoint unit) only repair damage at the beginning of their owner's turn. (veqryn)</li>
	<li>Coded and added Bunker rules, included as an option. No longer need edit mode to place bunkers. (code by crystalct and veqryn)</li>
	<li>Bunkers (Constructions) code updated to work differently.  Factories are now also isConstructions for the purposes of placement. New game properties listed below (all On by default). (veqryn)
	<ul><li>"More Constructions with/without Factory" - If ON then you may have a total number of bunkers up to the PU value of a territory (minimum 1), in territories with/without factories. If OFF then you may have only 1 total bunker per territory.</li>
		<li>"Unlimited Constructions" - If ON it over-rides above 2 game properties to allow infinite total bunkers per territory. If OFF then things are determined by the above 2 game properties.</li>
		<li>No matter what, you can only place 1 bunker per territory per round. Bunkers do not take up a factory slot when being placed.</li></ul></li>
	<li>Updated NWO to take advantage of triggered rule changes to have red dot units and bunkers not appear for purchasing during beginning turns, and the ability to turn them off completely by deselecting "Use Triggers". (added to nwo by Veqryn, code by Squid Daddy)</li>
